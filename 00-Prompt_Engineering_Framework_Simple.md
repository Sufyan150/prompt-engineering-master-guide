# 🧩 Prompt Engineering Framework — Simple English Version
_A clear, step-by-step explanation for learners and beginners_

---

## 🌟 Overview
This framework breaks prompt engineering into **6 main parts** — each helps you design better AI prompts that give accurate, consistent, and useful results.

| # | Part | Purpose |
|---|------|----------|
| 1 | Command | Tell the model exactly what to do |
| 2 | Context | Give background information |
| 3 | Logic | Explain how you want the model to think |
| 4 | Roleplay | Tell the model who it should act like |
| 5 | Formatting | Describe how the answer should look |
| 6 | Questions | Ask the model to clarify or improve your prompt |

---

## 1️⃣ Command — Tell the Model What to Do

### ✅ What It Means
The “Command” is your **main instruction** — what you actually want the AI to do.

### 🪜 Step-by-Step
1. Start your prompt with a strong action verb (Generate, Explain, Design, Write, etc.).
2. Be direct and specific about the result you want.
3. Keep it short and clear.

### 💡 Example
> “Generate a 7-day workout plan for beginners who have 30 minutes a day and no equipment.”

### 👍 Pros
- Clear and focused output  
- Faster and more accurate responses  

### 👎 Cons
- Too narrow = might limit creativity  
- Too broad = confusing for AI  

### 🕒 When to Use
Always — every prompt should begin with a clear command.

---

## 2️⃣ Context — Give the Right Background

### ✅ What It Means
The “Context” gives the AI extra details so it understands *who*, *what*, *when*, and *why*.

### 🪜 Step-by-Step
1. Describe **who** (audience or person).  
2. Explain **what** (goal, topic, or subject).  
3. Mention **when** (time, situation, or deadline).  
4. Add any important constraints (budget, tools, etc.).

### 💡 Example
> “For a 32-year-old software engineer who wants to buy a house in 5 years.”

### 👍 Pros
- Output becomes personalized and relevant.  
- AI makes fewer wrong assumptions.  

### 👎 Cons
- Too much detail can confuse the model.  
- Avoid giving private or sensitive data.  

### 🕒 When to Use
Use **more context** for complex tasks (like financial, technical, or long projects).

## 3️⃣ Logic — Explain How to Think

### ✅ What It Means
Logic tells the model **how to structure its thinking** and how the final answer should be built.

### 🪜 Step-by-Step
1. Explain what parts or sections you want in the answer.  
2. Tell the AI the order of steps (e.g., “First analyze, then compare, then summarize”).  
3. Specify the level of detail you expect.  
4. Mention any rules (“Use examples”, “Don’t assume anything”, etc.).

### 💡 Example
> “List each investment type, give percentage allocation, and explain in 1–2 sentences why it fits.”

### 👍 Pros
- Output becomes organized and ready to use.  
- Consistent structure across responses.  

### 👎 Cons
- Over-specified logic can feel robotic.  
- Missed steps might break flow.  

### 🕒 When to Use
When you need the AI to create structured results (e.g., reports, plans, or analysis).

## 4️⃣ Roleplay — Act Like an Expert

### ✅ What It Means
The Roleplay tells the AI **which professional role** it should simulate (e.g., teacher, doctor, developer).

### 🪜 Step-by-Step
1. Assign a role: “You are a marketing expert” or “You are a senior developer.”  
2. Mention years of experience or focus area.  
3. Define tone (formal, friendly, technical, persuasive).  
4. Optional — give a viewpoint (creative, analytical, etc.).

### 💡 Example
> “You are a certified financial advisor with 15 years of experience helping engineers invest smartly.”

### 👍 Pros
- AI speaks with the correct tone and expertise.  
- Answers become domain-specific and practical.  

### 👎 Cons
- The model isn’t a real expert — verify important info.  
- Too strict a role can limit creativity.  

### 🕒 When to Use
Whenever the topic needs expertise or professional tone.

## 5️⃣ Formatting — Control How the Output Looks

### ✅ What It Means
Formatting defines how the answer will be presented — lists, tables, markdown, code, etc.

### 🪜 Step-by-Step
1. Choose your preferred format (bullets, numbered, JSON, table, etc.).  
2. Ask for headings or sections.  
3. Define word count or structure if needed.  
4. Ask for ready-to-use formatting (for blogs, code, reports).

### 💡 Example
> “Show the answer as a markdown table with 3 columns: Step, Action, Description.”

### 👍 Pros
- Easier to copy-paste or reuse the output.  
- Saves time on reformatting.  

### 👎 Cons
- Wrong format = must retry prompt.  
- Some visuals (charts, diagrams) need external tools.  

### 🕒 When to Use
Always when you plan to share, publish, or import the result.

---

## 6️⃣ Questions — Let the Model Clarify

### ✅ What It Means
Ask the AI to **request missing details** — this improves the precision and personalization.

### 🪜 Step-by-Step
1. End your prompt with: “Ask 5–10 questions to tailor this better.”  
2. Answer them briefly.  
3. Rerun the prompt with those answers.

### 💡 Example
> “After writing the plan, ask 10 questions that will help make it more customized.”

### 👍 Pros
- AI fills gaps you forgot.  
- Each round becomes more accurate.  

### 👎 Cons
- Takes extra time to respond.  
- Too many questions can slow the process.  

### 🕒 When to Use
For complex or personal tasks — when accuracy and personalization matter.

## 💬 Final Tip
> “A great prompt is like a bridge between human intent and machine intelligence. The clearer your side is, the stronger the bridge becomes.”
